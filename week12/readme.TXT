Excercise: Week 12
########################################################################
The excercise was done by using Phaser3 framework, all assets are either
selfmade or free use for non profit endavours. THE GAME MIGHT WORK BY
JUST RUNNING THE INDEX.HTML FILE locally but in theory the game would
requirea a  web server to work. Specs and/or required services for
development were:
-Windows 10
-XAMPP for Windows 8.0.13
-Phaser 3.55.2 "Ichika"
-Version 96.0.4664.45 (Official Build) (64-bit)

Step by step running locally:
1. download "week12" folder from GitHub
2. Extract zip into a directory
3. execute index.html file
Step by step to replicate executing game in development with web server:
(Do the 1. and 2. steps from previous step by step)
1. install XAMPP for windows
2. Save game folder (named "week12") inside htdocs folder in xampp folder
exact location: ...\xampp\htdocs\
3. Open XAMPP control panel and start an Apache server
4. Go to browser and connect to: localhost/week12

WARNING: source code is very ugly and im 110% precent sure there are better
ways to do everything. This being the first project ever on Phaser3
framework I am learning the syntax and therefore the projects scope is 
small and the complexity is simple. (hopefully this will be worth atleast 1
point so I can get a pass on the excercises point minimum req ":D")
